Collection of micro-services for operations / runtime
management, for example:
○ Device reboots, pushing/rotating SSL keys/certs, BERT (bit error rate
testing on a link/port), ping testing
○ Ephemeral state management (clearing L2 neighbor discovery/spanning
tree, resetting a BGP neighbor session)
● Each service contains multiple RPCs, and is modeled in
Protobuf (similar to NETCONF/YANG rpc)
● Allow some control of legacy network protocols (not used in
Stratum)
○ E.g., spanning tree, MPLS LSPs, BGP
● Stratum has initial support for cert, file, diag, system
